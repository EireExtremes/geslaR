The **geslaR** package was designed to fetch the [GESLA][] dataset into
R, as a full dataset or as a subset of the data. There a few ways that
this can be achieved:

- Downloading the entire dataset locally, then loading it into R and
  working from there using the [Apache Arrow][] framework
  (`download_gesla()`)
- Querying the hosted dataset directly from R, specifying the desired
  subset (`query_gesla()`)
- Using the GESLA Shiny app (thereafter called only geslaR-app), to
  filter, visualise and possibly download subsets of the dataset
  (`run_gesla_app()`)

In the sections below, we will discuss each of these possibilities.

## Loading the package

When you first load the **geslaR** package into an R session, two more
packages will automatically be loaded: **arrow** and **dplyr**.

```{r setup, cache=FALSE}
library(geslaR)
```

These two packages are strictly necessary for dealing with a huge
dataset like GESLA, to alleviate the need to load it in memory all at
once. The full GESLA dataset has more than 1.7 billion lines, and is
nearly impossible to load it in R (or any other RAM memory language,
like e.g. Python) all at once. To avoid this problem, there are two
possibilities:

1. Load (smaller) subsets of the full dataset
2. Use an "in-memory" analytics framework

In the best case scenario, these two approaches can be used together for
maximum efficiency, and the **geslaR** package was designed to achieve
this.

Regardless the way the GESLA data is loaded into R, the best way to deal
with it is using the [Apache Arrow][] framework. For a more detailed
explanation and examples, please see the `vignette("intro-to-arrow")`.

## Downloading the full GESLA dataset

If you want to explore the full GESLA dataset, you can download it with
the `download_gesla()` function as follows

```{r dir, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
if(!dir.exists("gesla_dataset")) download_gesla(ask = FALSE)
```

```{r dwl, eval=FALSE}
download_gesla()
```

This will create a directory called `gesla_dataset` in the current
working directory (as defined by `getwd()`) and download the full
dataset locally. This download may take some time (expect around 5 to 10
minutes), as it depends on internet connection. Note that this full
dataset will need at least 7GB of (hard drive) storage, so make sure
this is feasible. However, once downloaded, you will have access to the
full dataset, and you will only need to do this once.

You will notice that the full dataset is composed of 5119 [Apache
Parquet][] files, ending in `.parquet`

```{r len}
## Number of downloaded files
length(list.files("gesla_dataset"))
## Check the first files
head(list.files("gesla_dataset"))
```

These files are the same as those originally distributed in the GESLA
dataset, so that each one refers to a site from where the data comes
from. To load this full dataset in R, use the `arrow::open_dataset()`
function, specifying the location of the `.parquet` files. Although
there are many files, this function recognises them as a single dataset,
because they all have the same structure (or "Schema").

```{r open}
## Open dataset
da <- open_dataset("gesla_dataset")
## Check the object
da
## Verify class
class(da)
```

Since this is an `ArrowObject` object, it will actually not load the
full dataset in memory (as it would if it was a standard R object, such
as a `tibble` or `data.frame`). Note, however, that some basic
information, such as `dim()` and `names()` can be retrieved simply with

```{r dim}
dim(da)
names(da)
```

Any other manipulation of the dataset must be made using
**dplyr** verbs. For example, to count the number of observations by
country, one could use

```{r ctr}
da |>
    count(country) |>
    collect()
```

## Querying subsets directly into R

The `query_gesla()` function can be used to load subsets of the full
GESLA dataset into R. This function will connect to the GESLA dataset
hosted on an Amazon AWS S3 bucket, and will automatically filter the
required piece of data. Note that the query may vary, as it will depend
on the size of the required subset and on internet connection speed.

The selection is made by specifying one or more countries, years and
site names. The only mandatory argument is `country`, where it should be
a character vector of three-letter [ISO 3166-1
alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) codes. If the
argument `year` is empty, then all available years for those countries
will be selected. The same occurs for the `site_name` argument.

For example, to select all the available data for Ireland (IRL), simply
use

```{r irl}
da <- query_gesla(country = "IRL")
da
dim(da)
names(da)
class(da)
```

This is also an `ArrowObject` object, and works the same way as any
other Arrow object type, i.e., it can be manipulated with **dplyr**
verbs. By the end of this section we will show some examples.

Many other queries can be made, for example,

```{r ex, eval=FALSE}
## Select one specific year
da <- query_gesla(country = "IRL", year = 2015)

## Multiple years
da <- query_gesla(country = "IRL", year = c(2015, 2017))
da <- query_gesla(country = "IRL", year = 2010:2017)
da <- query_gesla(country = "IRL", year = c(2010, 2012, 2015))

## Multiple countries
da <- query_gesla(country = c("IRL", "ATA"), year = 2015)
da <- query_gesla(country = c("IRL", "ATA"), year = 2010:2017)
```

As one last example, we may be interested in data only for the site
`Dublin_Port` in Ireland, and for the years 2015 and 2017. This query
would be done as follows

```{r dub}
da <- query_gesla(country = "IRL", year = c(2015, 2017),
    site_name = "Dublin_Port")
```

Now we could explore this subset using **dplyr** verbs as usual

```{r expl}
## Verifying number of observations per year
da |>
    count(year) |>
    collect()

## Calculating summary statistics per year
da |>
    group_by(year) |>
    summarise(
        min = min(sea_level),
        mean = mean(sea_level),
        max = max(sea_level)) |>
    collect()
```

Note the use of the `dplyr::collect()` function at the end of each call.
This is necessary to convert the final result (which is processed by
Arrow) to a common R object (usually a `tibble` or similar).

As stated before, the queries made by `query_gesla()` may take some
time to process. To avoid repeating this query in every new session, you
can save this object in a file locally, so it will be available
instantly the next time you may need it. To achieve this, you can use
the `write_gesla()` function

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_gesla(da)
```

In this case, this call will create a file named `gesla-data.parquet`,
and it will be ready for reading at any time, without the need for
querying again. At any time, just use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
da <- read_gesla("gesla-data.parquet")
```

to make it available again.

Please, do not try to save this object as a standard R file, such as
`.rds` or `.rda`, as using `saveRDS()` or `save()` for example. In this
case the resulting saved object will not be the same as the original
object, as an `ArrowObject` object is not a standard R object (it
actually is just a pointer to an Arrow style object).

The `query_gesla()` function also has two more arguments. The `use_flag
= 1` means that only the data suggested by the GESLA team as being
useful for analysis must be used. Please see the [GESLA format][] page
for more information. The other argument, `as_data_frame = FALSE`
specifies if the resulting object should be an `ArrowObject` (the
default) or a `data.frame`. We highly recommend to keep this default
option, as the resulting `data.frame` can be larger-than-memory,
resulting in a memory overflow or even an R session crash. Keeping the
object as an `ArrowObject` will always guarantee that the resulting
query will be made available. In any case, an `ArrowObject` can always
be converted to a `data.frame`, if that is desired, without the need to
repeat the query with `as_data_frame = TRUE`. For example, the object
`da` created above (which is an `ArrowObject`) may be converted to a
`data.frame` with

```{r conv}
class(da)
db <- da |>
    collect()
class(db)
```

## Using the GESLA Shiny app

The GESLA Shiny app (geslaR-app) was developed as a user-friendly
interface to explore the whole GESLA dataset. The app may be called
simply as

```{r, eval=FALSE}
run_gesla_app()
```

This will create a directory called `gesla-app` on the current working
directory, containing the necessary files for the app itself, and a
sub-directory called `gesla_dataset` containing all the GESLA dataset
files (as `.parquet` files, as this is done with the `download_gesla()`
function as explained above). Note that the first time this function is
called, it will create these directories and download the full GESLA
dataset. However, once this is done, the next time this function is
called on this working directory, only the app will open in the default
browser (no more downloads will be necessary).

This web-interface allows the user to apply some basic filters, by
choosing countries, years and sites. By doing this, the app will filter
the data and show information about the selected subset. The first
tab contains a preview of the selected subset. The two subsequent tabs
provide some plots with the number of observations by year, and summary
plots for the sea level data itself. The last tab will show a map with
the selected locations, and by clicking on the locations, a pop-up will
show information about that specific station.

<!-- Maybe some screenshots here -->

The user has the option to download the selected subset in CSV or
Parquet file formats. We highly recommend to export it as a Parquet
file, as the file size will be much smaller, and it can be simply loaded
into R with the `read_gesla()` function, creating an `ArrowObject`
object.
